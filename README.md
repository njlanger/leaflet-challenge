This assignment was written from what I learned in class. ChatGPT was used for debugging. My editing tool was Visual Studio, which helped with syntax errors before the code was run. Earthquake data is from USGS represented by all earthquakes from the past day. The street layer came from OpenStreet Map, as part of the Leaflet package. Tectonic plate data came from an open-source GitHub. The satellite layer is from Google Maps. 
The code can be found in Leaflet_Part_One/StarterCode/static/js/logic.js
The GitHub Page where the project is located is:
